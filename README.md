# Challenge-Module-2

## Overview of Project
This project focused on improving (refactor) an Excel VBA code to collect, compile and present a determined stock information for the years 2017 and 2018. The analysis is presented to showcase the final results (time processing) pre and post refactor.   

###  Results
 The improvement time is very clear. Currently the stocks analysis, runs at almost at a quarter of the original time previous to the improvement. See resources folder for information

##  Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

•	Advantages
o	Refactoring improves the code presentation and audit. 
o	Refactoring helps to design and deploy an easier code. 
o	Code after refactoring is easy to read and debug.  
•	Disadvantages
o	For a novice programmer refactoring can imply a new challenge, from the standpoint of bringing new and more sophisticated code. 


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

 The most important pro in refactoring the code is that the run time is far much lower. For the original code the run time was between 0.87 and 0.89 seconds. For this specific    application (stock analysis), with the new code run time is between 0.20 to 0.21 seconds.
